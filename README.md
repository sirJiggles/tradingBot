# What

This a bot that will run on my pi to do some trading for me. it can be stand alone
and run on some lambda later. but to be honest I can just run it on my pi for free
so ... why not

## How

It will talk to my binance API and make some smart trades on my behalf as I am not awake
24hours and would like to have something do some of the no brain trading for me.

It might get smarter and better later on, and if I put more time into it I will make it run in python more than likely but just for getting started with something ts will do for now
